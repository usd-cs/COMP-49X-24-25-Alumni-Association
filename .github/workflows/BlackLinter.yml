        #These are necessary to ignore because we need to import the entire settings into the dev, prod
        #files but the linter doesn't like this. Settings.py is also set up by Django and has some lines
        #that the linter also doesn't agree with. The linter will still process over all of the code that
        #we are actually writing.
